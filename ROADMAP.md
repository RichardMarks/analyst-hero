# Roadmap for Version 2

* an introduction that gives the player context

* interactive tutorial that teaches the player how to play

* larger environment/multiple rooms to explore

* dialogue boxes when you interact with an npc instead of printing to the console (that windows users are not going to see)

* collectable items (useful (combat or healing) and useless-for the sake of collecting, eg pencils and paperclips lol) and a visual inventory screen

* scene transitions (fade to color / fade from color) or slide left / slide right

* autonomous NPCs that roam the rooms on their own and appear to have their own "personalities" in that they don't all do the same thing always. Maybe one goes the water cooler then a coffee machine/break room, or in and out of a cubicle like annoying another NPC

* better fonts (browse dafont.com for 100% free fonts in the options when searching)

* a more attractive title screen that draws the player's attention and piques their interest when they start up the game

* audio (sfx for practically everything, and at least 2 background music tracks for in battle and out of battle)

* special effects, like emojis and thought bubbles that appear over NPC's heads at random intervals to make it appear like they have something on their mind, or are responding to something you say to them

* random "events" that may or may not happen in a day, like the copier jamming and everyone trying to use it gets pissed off. or the water cooler needs refilling and an NPC dumps water everywhere trying to put a new jug on it, etc...

* Boss text and numbers larger font

* make the bosses have different and more attacks

* visual special effects, and more visual feedback from game actions (like clicking on the computer, the water cooler, etc.)
