# Analyst Hero

## Overview

Goal: Get to 5pm without losing your chill (health) and defeat the bosses - literally!

### How to increase time, a.k.a. "work"

  1. "clicky clicky" on your computer when nearby to generate reports (and increase time)

  2. go to copier when nearby to increase report ammo (and increase time)

  3. spend time ( minus time) at your computer when nearby to create WCB Scripts to automate part of job ( increase 2x the time spent and 2x time increase multiplier for future "work")

  4. Talk to the single friendly senior analyst ( increase time and increase report ammo effectiveness)

  5. Talk to the two friendly coworkers ( increase time and increase report effectiveness)

### How to get to the next level

Once you've increased time to 5pm, then go to the boss' office to battle a.k.a "give an update". 

This starts a minigame where you will use your report ammo to defeat the boss! Higher report effectiveness means a better chance your reports will hit and with greater damage! 

If you lose the battle and still have health (chill), then you will have to go back to your computer to generate more reports and then go to the copier to get more report ammo. And go to the water cooler to regain health a.k.a. chill
