# Build Instructions

+ Download SDL2 SDL2_image SDL2_ttf mingw development libraries from libsdl.org
+ Create external/SDL2/32 and external/SDL2/64 directories
+ Extract the appropriate files from the dev libraries into the newly created directories

You should have:

```
external/SDL2/32/include
external/SDL2/32/lib
external/SDL2/32/bin
external/SDL2/32/share

external/SDL2/64/include
external/SDL2/64/lib
external/SDL2/64/bin
external/SDL2/64/share
```

Once this is done, you should be all set.
